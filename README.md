# MessageBoxTest
MessageBox Auto Testing suite (companion repository to MessageBoxTest_AutoTest)

This respository represents the simple student assignment for MessageBox to
demonstrate autograding in GitHub Classroom.

The **main.cpp** and **MessageBox.h** files are graded files.
The **tests.cpp** file is intended as a sample of how students can indepedently
test their code.  This file is not graded.

The automated tests use cpplint, diff, and google test, but these are **not**
required for the student respository (i.e., **MessageBoxTest**) and these tools
do not need to be installed on the student machine.

The autograding setup in GitHub Classroom must be done on this repository.
See the README.md from **MessageBox_AutoTest** for instructions on setting up
the automated tests.
